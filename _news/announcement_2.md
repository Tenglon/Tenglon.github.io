VISXP is a project on Interactive Visual Exploration of Media Archives, funded by ClickNL.
***

This project aims to make AI technology widely applicable within media archives based on interactive learning interfaces that enable users to explore the data visually. This requires research into combining the different types of data sources within archives, both for analysis and for displaying and visualizing in the interface.

The research for this is done in two research lines:

The first research line 'Multimedia Analytics' investigates new methods and techniques for interactive and learning exploration of media archive data at scale.
The second research line 'Computer Vision' focuses on the development of flexible algorithms for extracting information from visual archive data with a focus on generic and non-task-specific applications.
